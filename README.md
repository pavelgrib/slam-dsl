MSc project involving creation of a DSL for SLAM

openSLAM.org houses a set of open-source tools to perform Simultaneous Localization and Mapping for application to 
automated scene understanding.  Specific challenges include:

- localization
- detecting features from individual frames
- least-squares minimization involving sparce matrices
- Kalman filtering
- updating probability distributions
